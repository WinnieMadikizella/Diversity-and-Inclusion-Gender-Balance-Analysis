# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Gender-Balance-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes HR data to assess gender balance at the executive management level and identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for hiring, promotion, performance, turnover, executive gender balance, and age group. The analysis highlights potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving diversity goals.

## Objective
- Define KPIs to measure gender diversity and inclusion.
- Create visualizations that effectively represent HR data.
- Identify actionable insights to help organizations address gender imbalances.


## Key KPIs
1. Hiring Metrics:
   - % of hires (men)
   - % of hires (women)
2. Promotion Metrics:
   - % employees promoted (overall)
   - % of women promoted
   - Promotion rate gap
3. Performance Ratings:
   - Average performance rating (men vs. women)
   - Performance rating gap
4. Turnover:
   - % turnover (overall, men, and women)
   - Turnover rate gap

## Insights
- Recruitment practices favor male candidates.
- Women are underrepresented in mid-level management, creating a bottleneck for leadership roles.
- Workplace culture and higher turnover rates among women contribute to slow progress.

## Root Causes for Slow Progress in Achieving Gender Balance
- Hiring Bias - Recruitment practices may unintentionally favor male candidates, especially for leadership roles.
  Limited outreach to diverse talent pools could lead to fewer female candidates.
- Promotion Pipeline Issues - Women may be underrepresented in mid-level management, creating a bottleneck for promotion to executive roles.
  Bias in performance evaluations may influence decisions about promotions.
- Workplace Culture - A male-dominated leadership environment can unintentionally create a less inclusive culture for women.
  Lack of mentorship and sponsorship opportunities for women may hinder their career advancement.
- Education and Awareness - Leadership teams may lack awareness of unconscious bias or may not prioritize diversity as a strategic goal.
- Performance Evaluation - Gender disparities in performance ratings could reflect inherent biases in assessment criteria or processes.
